===============

`UPCardsCarousel` is a carousel with a cards based UI for iOS.

## Requirements

`UPCardsCarousel` uses ARC and requires iOS 7.0+.

Works for iPhone.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

UPCardsCarousel is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "UPCardsCarousel"
```

### Manual

Simply copy the folder `UPCardsCarousel` to your project and import it in XCode.

## Usage

Start by importing the header file:

```objc
#import "UPCardsCarousel.h"
```

Now, you can create a `UPCardsCarousel` object by giving it a frame:

```objc
UPCardsCarousel *carousel = [[UPCardsCarousel alloc] initWithFrame:aFrame];
```

Then you need to assign to it:

* a `delegate` object that conforms to the `UPCardsCarouselDelegate` protocol
* a `dataSource` object that conforms to the `UPCardsCarouselDataSource` protocol

### Data Source

The data source informs the carousel about the total number of cards and the content of each card through two self-explanatory methods:

* `- (NSUInteger)numberOfCardsInCarousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel` (required)
* `- (UIView *)carousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel viewForCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index` (required)

The labels in the banner are given with an optional method. If the data source doesn't implement this method, the label banner will not be displayed.

* `- (NSString *)carousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel labelForCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index` (optional)

### Delegate

The delegate is optional and will be notified when some events occur:

* `- (void)carousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel didTouchCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index`
* `- (void)carousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel willDisplayCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index`
* `- (void)carousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel willHideCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index`
* `- (void)carousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel didDisplayCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index`
* `- (void)carousel:(UPCardsCarousel *)carousel didHideCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index`

### Methods

| Method                                       | Description                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| reloadData                                   | Reloads the carousel data and recreates the visible cards and moves to the top of the cards deck             |
| reloadDataWithCurrentIndex:(NSUInteger)index | Reloads the carousel data and recreates the visible cards and moves to the specified index in the cards deck |
| reloadNumberOfCards                          | Reloads only the number of cards in the carousel and doesn't change the visible cards                        |
| reloadCardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index          | Recreates the card at the specified index                                                                    |
| cardAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index                | Return the card view at the specified index                                                                  |

### Customization

#### Cards Deck

Usually, the carousel will not display all the cards supplied by the data source at once. It will handle a infinite scrolling process by destroying and creating cards at both ends. The number of visible cards is given and can be customized through the following property:

* `maxVisibleCardsCount` (default is 6)

You can customize the duration of the card movement between the hidden deck and the visible deck, with this property:

* `movingAnimationDuration` (defaut is 0.4 seconds)

By default, the carousel will return to the top of the deck when making a double-tap on the first hidden card.

You can disable this behaviour by setting the `doubleTapToTop` property to `NO`.

#### Labels Banner

You can customize the text font and color of the banner through these two methods:

* `- (void)setLabelFont:(UIFont *)font` (default is system font)
* `- (void)setLabelTextColor:(UIColor*)color` (default is `[UIColor blackColor]`)

You can choose between two locations for the banner through the `labelBannerPosition` property:

* `UPCardsCarouselLabelBannerLocation_bottom` - the banner will be located below the cards deck (default)
* `UPCardsCarouselLabelBannerLocation_top` - the banner will be located above the cards deck

Finally, you also have access to the banner view object through the `labelBanner` property so you can customize it as you want.
